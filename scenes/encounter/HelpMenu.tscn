+25: Participate in a winning battle
+5: Defeat an enemy in battle
+5: Rejoin a formation (hitting x when not in formation)
+1: Land a blow on an enemy in battle
-2: Rotate to the back of the line (hitting r)
-10: Break formation (hitting x when in formation)
-50: Leaving the battlefield before your army is defeated

You do NOT lose score if your unit is routed. If your unit is routed, the formation breaks and you are considered out of formation and cannot fight, but as you did not intentionally break formation there is not penalty.
You do NOT lose score if you retreat after every unit in your army is routed.

To maximize your prestige, you should attempt to defeat as many enemies in battle as you can, and avoid breaking formation until your unit loses cohesion.

If your unit routs, you will automatically be ejected from the formation (as a routing unit has no formation).

You can rejoin a formation or join a different unit's formation by approaching its center and pressing x. The screen overlay text will tell you when you are close enough.

text = "You fight enemies by moving into them. The attack formula is:
(modified melee attack - modified melee defense) < 1d100
Melee attack and defense are modified by the footing penalty.

Footing is a value that represents the balance and stamina of the combatant. Each attack made by a combatant reduces their footing by 5. Once footing drops to less than 70% of the max, the combatant gets a penalty to all attack and defense rolls. The penalty starts at -10 and goes down to -30 at 20%. If it drops below 20%, the penalty goes to 9999.

Footing can also absorb some of the damage dealt to a fighter. If a fighter would take damage, the fighter will instead take some percentage of the damage as footing damage, depending on how much footing they currently have.

You regain footing by using the Wait command, which restores 33% of your footing."
