You are supposed to be watching the soldier in front of you. You swallow. It is very hard to concentrate, but it's important that you watch the soldier in front of you. You need to be ready, in case he rotates out, or in case he falls. It is important that you be ready, or he might stumble back into you and then you might fall, and if you might fall you might die, and you don't want to die. You definitely don't want to die.

\"Rotating!\" cries the soldier in front of you. You swallow and prepare to replace him.

Secondary to surviving is wining prestige (score). You win prestige by participating in winning battles, wounding or slaying foes, and sticking to your formation.

You lose prestige by rotating to the rear of the line. Of course, it's better to lose some prestige than to die! You can also throw down your weapons and break out of the formation completely, if you're being overwhelmed, but no true Roman soldier would flee from battle like that, would they? On the other hand, if the entire army is already defeated, you'll lose no prestige for managing to escape."
