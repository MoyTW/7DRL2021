* Summary

A roguelike where you're one participant of many. Think a single footsoldier in
a Lord's retinue, or a legionary in a legion.

* Pre-Comp Design Notes

+ Turn ordering is going to be a HUGE issue; simultaneous turns seems like the
  best option here
+ The lethality model has to be different than the "fight until 0 HP", given
  that most people didn't straight-up die unless they were unlucky, badly
  overmatched, or in a rout
+ Stamina should be extremely important, in that rotating, disengaging, and
  other forms of relief should be a thing
+ Terrain is almost certainly going to be "huge flat plains" for most of this,
  because that's much easier to deal with than obstructions
+ We'll have to build some formation marching AI
